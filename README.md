# Random-Forest-Regression
This repository is intended to provide you with an overview of the random forest regression model. Data preprocessing is not performed within this model.

 Random forest regression is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to obtain a final output. Each decision tree is built on a random subset of the training data and features.

 Randomness is introduced in random forest regression by selecting a random subset of features at each split of a decision tree. This helps to reduce overfitting and increases the diversity among the individual trees.

 Random forest regression uses a technique called bagging (bootstrap aggregating) to create different subsets of the training data through random sampling with replacement. Each decision tree is trained on a different subset, which introduces variation and reduces the impact of outliers.

 In random forest regression, predictions are made by averaging the predictions of all individual decision trees. The aggregated predictions tend to be more stable and accurate than those of a single decision tree.

 Random forest regression is robust to overfitting and noisy data. The combination of multiple decision trees helps to smooth out the noise and make more reliable predictions.

 Random forest regression can handle missing data effectively. It can make predictions using available features without the need for imputation or removal of missing values.

 Random forest regression can handle large datasets with high dimensionality efficiently. The algorithm parallelizes the training process, making it suitable for both small and big data scenarios.


 ## I will build a proper random forest regression model in the future where data preprocessing steps will also be performed within the model. ##
